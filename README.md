# Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Project Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore, clean, and analyze the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation dataset containing over 38,000 project records funded globally from 1994 to present. The goal is to perform a complete **Data Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow** including:

* Data Access & Loading (CSV/Excel)
* Data Cleaning & Deduplication
* Feature Engineering (e.g., extracting year from dates)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  * Categorical Data Analysis (grantee, country, topic, division, region)
  * Numerical Data Analysis (amount committed, duration in months)
  * Rwanda-specific insights
* Visualization of trends, top topics, and top grantees
* Interactive geographic visualizations (Africa and Rwanda projects)

This project also demonstrates a **cloud data engineering workflow** with AWS services (S3, IAM, CLI) to store, query, and manage the dataset.

## Key Features

* Flexible data loading supporting both CSV and Excel.
* Automated data cleaning and deduplication.
* Differentiation of categorical and numerical features.
* Interactive visualizations using **Plotly** and **Seaborn**.
* Rwanda-specific analysis highlighting funding trends, top topics, and grantees.
* AWS integration for data storage and potential ETL pipelines.
